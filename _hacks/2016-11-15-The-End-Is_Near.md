A little too cliched name for the first post right? Well, Jekyll threw a sample "Hello World" post at me right out of the box, so I figured might as well continue the tradition.

What's thing blog going to be about? Well, at this point of time I myself don't know. I'm going to spend a day or two fidling around with Jekyll and figuring out how everything works around here. After that it's mostly going to be a ton of articles on random things off the top of my head.

It would be unfair to not give credit to [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) which powers this blog.

Thanks to [Jerin Philip](https://github.com/jerinphilip) for introducing me to Jekyll and also to [Tom Preston-Werner](http://tom.preston-werner.com/) for creating Jekyll

Also, I'm going to keep this as active as possible. Shall try to squeeze in atleast one post everyweek.
