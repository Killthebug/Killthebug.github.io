So yeah, today I met Olmo. When I was headed to the airport to pick him up, I didn't have the slightest thought in my head that I would end up documenting the little time I spent with him. We didn't speak in the car on the way back or at the hotel. It was only at the venue, once his gig was done that we came to know each other better.

Olmo is a crazy person. He's from a beautiful island in the carribeans but spent a major part of his life in Italy and Germany. As of now he lives in Amsterdam where he produces music, parties and cooks some amazing food. My coversations with Olmo started off just talking about how his set was not his "typical" style tonight. He played a rather mellow techno house, while he would have prefered playing more hardstyle.

The conversation slowly moved on and I started learning some really interesting things about him. Olmo studied electronic music and jazz at his university. He plays the trumpet and uses an acoustic drum to get the crowds going at his gigs. We then spoke about all the gigs he's played and how he ended up in India. He'd been in India for a while now and had just spent a week in Goa. If someone told me that Olmo was born and brought up in Goa, I would totally buy it. He seems to be in love with the place!

It's somewhere in the middle of all this matierialistic talk that Olmo inspired me. He told me things that require courage to be said. He didn't deliver a speech or drop some badass punch lines but he explained to me how life was amazing if you could just do the things that you love. He spoke about how he chased his passion to just play the drums and produce music that's gotten him where he is right now. Olmo never said that the journey to make life "perfect" was a easy one. He just said that it was his decision to make it fun and THAT, exactly that got to me. It's not about preparing for the future and planning and preparing all the time that's important. If we live like that, a future will never really come and we'll end up chasing these "goals" forever. It's about making the journey to wherever life may be going fun (This line in only clichÃªd until you understand what it actually means). 

If I write more, I think I'm just going to bore myself and that technially defeats the purpose of everything that I've written so far.

Thanks a lot Olmo.
