*Drum Rolls*

I finally get the time to do what I've been pending for almost a year now. It's time to Explore Madhya Pradesh! In the next two weeks starting from the 8th of December, I shall be exploring the beautiful state of Madhya Pradesh.

If you don't already know, I'm from Indore which happens to be in MP and yet I've never really explored that very state. So the plan is to take reach Bhopal via the A.P Samparkranti and then take a bus to Khajuraho. *Stop giggling*

I plan to stay at the Zostel in Khajuraho for about 4 days before I move to explore Sanhci, Indore and Mandav. When in Khajuraho, I'll probably visit Orcha, Panna and a ton of temples in and around the town.

This is going to be one of my longer solo trips and supposedly one of the best. I'll try and keep everything on the blog so that I alone can read it all. (No one really reads this or knows that this exists)

Also, did I tell you I was planning to record my entire Journey and make a movie out of it. Sounds super cool right?

Awesome, I shall see you around! :D
