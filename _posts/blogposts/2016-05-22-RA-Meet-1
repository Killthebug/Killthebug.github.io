Relevance measure
Detect location of content in page
Shreya has tried to extract those elements which are semantically equivalent.

Syndication only : If a drug, patient and a negative effect on that paitent had been mentioned and the author is mentioned. 

First level : We know that this article has the drug
Second : Find if patient is mentioned. No names are given. Nomenclature changes.
Third : Negative effect has been mentioned which we do not exactly
Last : This patient took this drug and had this negative effect. 
These alll need ot be true to make it relevant

NO : high precision but low recall

High Recall (1 Recall) : Moderate Precision = GOAL (50% correct marked)

Sentence level representation building

Cannot do tables in parsing. Only deal with text.

PDFs converted to texts already.

Task 1 : Make primary folder : positive samples, whereever there’s a pdf which has to be in the positive folder, 
it must be there. We connect pdfs to the names in the excell sheet. First column in syndicated_articles.csv is the publication id and that’s what we want to match.
