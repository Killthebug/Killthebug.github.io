title: Hello World!
---

A little too cliched name for the first post right? Well, Jekyll threw a sample "Hello World" post at me right out of the box, so I figured might as well continue the tradition.

What's thing blog going to be about? Well, at this point of time I myself don't know. I'm going to spend a day or two fidling around with Jekyll and figuring out how everything works around here. After that it's mostly going to be a ton (figuratively) of articles on random things off the top of my head.

Also, it would be unfair to not give credit to [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) which powers this blog.

Also, I'm going to keep this as active as possible, shall try to squeeze in atleast one post everyweek.
